Cucumber Automation Framework setup 
Developed Automation Framework Using Maven Project

JDK - 1.7 Maven-3.0.5

Tech

I have used below technologies and editors:

[IntelliJ] - awesome for developing automation framework!
[Maven Project] - for organising framework structure.
[Cucumber-JVM] - its a tool that executes plain text functional descriptions as automated tests.
[Cucumber-JUnit] - to run the tests
[Slenium Webdriver] - it automates browsers. That's it!
[JDK] - To develop and run the tests.

You have to clone the Maven project in to your Local Machine:

Running 
 through Command Prompt:

$ git clone [git-repo-url]
$ cd QaWorks
$ mvn clean install
